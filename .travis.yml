# Added per React Create App errata stuff
language: generic 

# Get Docker ready
services:

before_install:
# Use a tag here since we won't easily get the ID back
# Tag only used in this Travis process so could use anything.

# How to run the test suite.
# Any code not zero means broken
# Travis assumes it ran, or errored.
# NPM run test never exists on its own so it will wait until you give a result
# adding "-- --coverage" changes the default command to generate the correct
# output once it runs the tests (which is automatically on startup)
#
# -e CI=true added due to React Create App issues.
  - docker run -e CI=true rpetty2012/docker-react npm run test -- --coverage
